			<Text>Benson-class destroyer, USS Laffey, your bravery has become a legendary tale known to all. In the Battle of Guadalcanal, you pierced the night sky like a brilliant meteor, leaving behind a illustrious example in the hearts of all. Even though you are covered in wounds, even if you are in flames, you fight bravely until the final silence. The Pacific has witnessed your tenacious soul of glory and sacrifice, and now awaits you to write a new chapter of glory.</Text>

			<Text>Laffey's military power should not be underestimated, her units do not suffer combat penalties when damaged, and gain a [ICON_Strength] Combat Strength bonus when facing stronger enemies and being flanked. By killing enemies in battle, Laffey is able to trigger the [ICON_TECHBOOSTED] Eureka of Technology and the [ICON_CIVICBOOSTED] Inspiration of the Civic for the Eagle Union. If these technologies and civics [ICON_TECHBOOSTED] Eureka or [ICON_CIVICBOOSTED] Inspiration have already been triggered, they will be unlocked immediately. This will rapidly advance the process of science and technology and culture of the Eagle Union, and make the Eagle Union at the forefront of the world. Coupled with the [ICON_PRODUCTION] Production and [ICON_FAITH] Faith bonuses that the waters tiles provide to the cities built on the shore, Laffey will easily lead to any victory.</Text>

			<Text>On March 31, 1942, Major William E. Hank was ordered to become its commander. In August of that year, after training along the west coast, Laffey sailed for the South Pacific. Its destination was the Solomon Islands, and its mission was to regain control of Guadalcanal (or Guadalcanal, hereafter Guadalcanal) from the Japanese. Laffey joined a task force headed by Hooper, and along with Hornet, escorted fuel and reinforcements to Henderson Field.</Text>

			<Text>On September 15 of the same year, the Japanese submarine I-19 attacked the Hoopoe, with three oxygen torpedoes scoring direct hits on the side of the ship and detonating the ship's fuel tanks, causing irreparable damage, which was ultimately punished by Lance with a lightning strike, which killed 193 of the men on board, and slightly and seriously injured 367 of them. During this incident, Laffey rescued many of the survivors and sent them to Espiritu Santo (hereafter Santo). It then joined Task Force 64.2 under the command of cruisers San Francisco, Salt Lake City, Boise, and Helena. Their mission was to disrupt the Japanese Tokyo Express operation and prevent the Japanese Navy from delivering much-needed supplies and reinforcements to the Japanese garrison on Gua Island.</Text>

			<Text>During the night of October 11-12, 1942, the Battle of Cape Esperance came to its fiercest moment. Task Force 64.2 held the entrance to Savo Channel (part of the Iron Bottom Channel), with destroyers in line, with Farenhoek, Duncan, and Laffey in the vanguard; and Buchanan and McCalla in the rearguard.At 2325, Helena's radar caught the enemy fleet approaching, and Task Force Commander Norman Scott ordered a turn to block the shipping lanes between Cape Espaunce and Savo Island. As a result, they would take a short cut and come directly up against the oncoming Japanese. The turn was made with the pioneer destroyers slowing first, then regaining the lead. As she began her alert activities, Laffey spotted the heavy cruiser Aoba and fired on her with a single 5-inch gun. Aoba's bridge took a direct hit, killing and wounding the command staff, and Rear Admiral Cunzhi Gotoh, commander of the Sixth Battle Group, had his legs blown off and later died of his wounds.</Text>

			<Text>On November 11, the fleet arrived at Cape Ronga and prepared to unload its escort of supplies and reinforcements to Henderson Field. That morning, enemy bombers attacked the transports and freighters, but were quickly driven off, so that the loss of men and material was slight, after which the crews resumed unloading at Cape Ronga. The following day, the fleet sailed to the Savo Channel to intercept the enemy's sea assault force advancing toward Gua Island and Henderson Airfield. on the night of November 12, the American task force broke into the Savo Channel from the west to meet the Japanese fleet approaching from the opposite direction with the intention of destroying Henderson Airfield, kicking off the grueling Battle of Guadalcanal, the first night battle of the Third Battle of the Solomon Sea. Before dawn on Friday, November 13th, the two sides were locked in battle, in darkness and confusion, making it difficult to distinguish between friend and foe. Many men, many ships, went to sleep in the Iron Bottom Channel, never to return to the sun. For this reason, this naval battle is also known as the Battle of Black Friday.</Text>

			<Text>Callahan took Scott's advice and met the Japanese fleet in three columns. Laffey (presumably due to his excellent performance) was once again in the vanguard, followed by Streeter and O'Bannon. Early in the battle, the Japanese launched an all-out strike on Atlanta, destroying the bridge. Scott, who had been instrumental in the Battle of Cape Esperance and had first defeated the Japanese in a night battle, was killed in action, and only one of the command cadre group survived. She was abandoned and sunk at noon on the 13th due to severe damage.</Text>

			<Text>In the midst of the melee, the Japanese commander, Hiroki Abe's flagship, the battleship Hiei, meets Cushing, Laffey, O'Bannon, and Sterrett in a narrow path. Cushing, which had already taken heavy shelling earlier, saw Hiei appear in front of it. Its captain immediately fired six torpedoes, three of which hit Hiei's hull but did not explode. Shortly afterward, an unharmed Hiei leaned over, illuminated Cushing with a searchlight, and reduced it to a twisted heap of wreckage on the deck with gunfire. Because of the searchlight, Hiei came under fire from the American ships. Cushing, which was ablaze, was abandoned and drifted away, killing about 60 people. It was witnessed drifting until the afternoon of the 13th when it exploded and sank.</Text>

			<Text>After such a success, the short-lived destroyer was attacked by several Japanese destroyers and then fatally wounded by the main guns of Hiei (said to be Kirishima). At the same time, an oxygen torpedo fired by Nagara (said to be Shogetsu) blew off her stern. With the destruction of the generators (one says the boilers took a direct hit), the ship went up in flames, and the flawed hull went completely out of control and collapsed. The commander ordered the crew to abandon ship, but the crew realized that the surrounding sea was not safe either. The depth charges carried by the ship were exploding, not only tearing through her hull, but also raining down countless pieces of burning debris, killing many of the people floating and sinking around her. The Laffey sank.</Text>

			<Text>The Laffey's battle greatly boosted the morale of the U.S. Navy and the public. Her heroic deeds were immediately published in the major newspapers to inspire the people, including Admiral Halsey, Commander-in-Chief of the South Pacific Theater of Operations, who also wrote letters of commendation. Lieutenant Commander William E. Hank, captain of the Laffey, was posthumously awarded the Navy Cross with Gold Star for extraordinary bravery; six men below the rank of first officer were awarded the Silver Star, Bronze Star, or Navy and Marine Corps Medal. In all, the Laffey received three battle stars during her short eight-month career.</Text>

She rendered assistance to the crew of the (USS Hooper) despite the presence of enemy submarines still in the vicinity; she repulsed an enemy torpedo plane attack after her prominence at the Battle of Cape Esperance; and in the duel at Savo Island, Laffey, though battered and on fire, dealt a severe blow to the advancing enemy.

			<Text>The Benson class began with a requirement for five single guns and three quad torpedoes, like the Sims class, but it was later decided to have two quintuple torpedoes on the centerline. The biggest improvement was the arrangement of the power area, she was the first destroyer to have alternating boiler compartments and engine compartments, which minimized the risk of total loss of the power plant in the event of damage to the ship. As she had an engine room between the two boiler compartments, the two chimneys were very far apart.</Text>
